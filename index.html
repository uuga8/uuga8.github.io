<font face="Bahnschrift Light"><p> My name is Ilga, and you have landed on the website of my programming portfolio. FYI, you will find my github profile <a href="https://github.com/uuga8"> here</a>.</p>

I've been learning programming since December 2020, starting with python, and the contents of the present page is just about to grow, as are my programming skills. :)</p>

A long time ago, my professional career started in philology and then gradually migrated to the world of fintech. I also have a thing for photography and beekeeping.</p>

<br>Let's program away, my friends!</p></br>
